we are going to take a collection of Dinosaurs that we have taimed in Ark, and build an application that serves as a library. 
We want to be able to search for dinos, add and delete dinosaurs, provide text for a description, and add a name for the dinosaurs.

The model should have the following
Original level
Level at now
Base stats
Dino Species


This is a single page application following the setup of the Comics catalog dfrom Control and Composition pattern part 2
Key things:

Use of Composition in controls
Really good separation of concerns with the MVC style of architecture

Part 2:
I want you to write a program that will auto assign breeding partners for dinosaurs based on stats.
It will need to predict the best possible super dino that can be bred.
t will also need to predict the best number of generations before achieving said super dino, 
Best of the main stats:
Hp, Stam, melee, and weight.
