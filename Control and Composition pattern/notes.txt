Composition notes:

Taking multiple controls and putting them together to create a bigger control. The bigger control can then be used repeatedly for accomplishing tasks

Start with a static test:
Create a static test page for testing the wireframe.
We started with the wireframe for the control, then we created a new HTML page in order to construct the HTML as it needs to be layed out.
Then, using Javascript, we created the custom HTML string that creates the control we built.
